# Genotoxicity-prediction

**Prediction Genotoxicity using in vitro / in vivo dataset**  




## Description

We predicted the genotoxicity of compounds using in vitro / in vivo datasets derived from published hERGAT models (Cardiotoxicity prediction model)

In vitro data were extracted from the Ames test, while in vivo data were obtained from PubChem, eChemPortal, and the QSAR ToolBox database.

Genotoxicity was assessed separately for both the in vitro and in vivo datasets.

In addition, we provide a Python file that can be used to generate predictions from the model we trained.
